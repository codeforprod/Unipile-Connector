# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

### Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning packages

When you're ready to release, run:

```bash
pnpm version-packages
```

This will:
1. Consume all changesets
2. Update package versions
3. Update changelogs

### Publishing packages

To publish to NPM:

```bash
pnpm ci:publish
```

## CI/CD Integration

The release workflow automatically handles versioning and publishing:

1. When changesets exist, it creates a "Version Packages" PR
2. When that PR is merged, packages are automatically published to NPM
3. GitHub releases are created with the changelog content

## Linked Packages

This repository uses linked versioning for `@unipile/*` packages.
When one package gets a version bump, all linked packages get the same bump.
