# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to use

### Adding a changeset

When you make a change that needs to be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have been changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (patch, minor, or major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning packages

To update package versions based on changesets:

```bash
pnpm version-packages
```

### Publishing packages

To publish all packages to npm:

```bash
pnpm release
```

## Linked packages

The following packages are linked (versioned together):
- `@unipile/*` - All packages in the @unipile scope

This means when one linked package has a major/minor/patch bump, all linked packages get the same bump.

## CI/CD Integration

The release workflow automatically:
1. Creates a "Version Packages" PR when changesets are detected
2. Publishes packages to npm when the version PR is merged
3. Creates GitHub releases with changelogs

### Required secrets

- `NPM_TOKEN` - npm access token for publishing packages
